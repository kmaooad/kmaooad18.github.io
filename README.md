## Discussions and questions

There is a chat in Gitter, click [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/kmaooad18/course-home](https://badges.gitter.im/kmaooad18/course-home.svg)](https://gitter.im/kmaooad18/course-home?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) to join. There are several channels there. This repo channel (course-home) is for discussing lectures, theoretical issues, general ideas on topic (OOAD), and for _important_ organizational announcements. Please, ask common questions in this public channel, not in personal chat, so that everyone could benefit from the discussion. Also, for assignment-specific discussions, use their own channels (gitter button is in every assignment repo). Don't ask assignment questions in general channel.

## Quizzes

[Quiz W8](https://classroom.github.com/a/ugmQq7cC) (Deadline **28/10**)



## Assignments

Every week assignment deadline is 01:00 AM on next Monday (_after_ next week!)

Assignments are assessed by successful run of _all_ tests from Spec.cs (you can check that locally in advance — see [below](https://github.com/kmaooad18/course-home#implementing-assignment)). Check your results on [builds summary](/builds) page. Green build badge means your solution passes all tests on build server. This always reflects the latest available build and you can use this page as a mark of state of your repository. To get max points (3p) for your solution you have to provide passing build by deadline. Only the latest commit _before_ the deadline is checked for passing build. Same applies to extended deadline to get half points (1.5p). Bottom line is: it does not matter if you had passing build some time before deadline, but broke it right before the deadline! Only last commit always matters. That is how it works in real life, so try to be careful from the start.

### Accessing assignment

1. Create your personal GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Login to GitHub and follow one of the assigment links above
3. On your first opening some assignment, GitHub will request access from Classroom to your account — that's totally ok, just grant access.
4. As you accept the assignment, GitHub will create your personal private repository and put starter code for assignment there. Your repository will be named like 'assignment-w4-yournickname' etc. **Make sure your repository name matches the mentioned pattern, it is absolutely required to match your repo to you and grade properly!**
5. Further use your personal repository from the previous step to complete and submit assignment.

### Implementing assignment

1. Assigments are implemented with .NET Core 2.1 or later. 
2. To be able to develop, build, and run assignments you will need to install [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1). (You are not limited to Windows since .NET Core is a cross-platform framework)
3. You are free to use any editor you like or even go pure command-line, but the recommended IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (it's also cross-platform, it's nice, lightweight, simple, yet powerful). There is also a [portable version](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable) that does not need installation.
4. To build the assignment, clone your repository from GitHub, in VS Code terminal or plain command line go to project folder (you need one with .csproj file in it), and execute `dotnet build`, or you may use `dotnet run` to build and run at once.
5. Assignment comes as a starter code, typically one or more main code files (.cs) and Spec.cs file with specification tests.
6. You need to fill main code file(s) with your implementation so that the program does what's expected. Start code in main files provides classes stubs, method stubs etc. You need to implement provided methods and/or add more of your own, if necessary.
7. A good sign of properly implemented program (in terms of spec) is successful run of tests from Spec.cs. To check those, execute `dotnet test` or `dotnet xunit`. You'll see if some requirements do not hold — test(s) will fail.
8. Don't try to cheat the tests: there are more on the teacher's side to make sure your implementation is the _real_ one, not just the tests-cheater :)
9. Commit and push your progress to GitHub regularly: local PC crash sometimes. Make sure you commit and push your work in advance before the deadline. **Last commit _before_ the deadline will be taken for assessment.**


## Resources

There is no just one book or several books that could be a substitute for this course. Yet there are books that are somewhat classics in OOD field and altogether can help to build initial body of knowledge. Also, mentioned books are refered to throughout the course for better source linking on certain topics or issues.
